# Important Notice

I'm no longer actively maintaining this project. If you are interested supporting it - [ping me on twitter](https://twitter.com/vesln).
The only thing that I will ask you is to not change the API drastically. If you are planning on doing that - better start a brand new project.

If you want me to transfer you only the name on npm, I'd be happy to only if the project **does not have any downloads on npm lately**. In case it's being
downloaded, there are people that depend on it and might step up and start maintaining, so I will not transfer it to you, regardless if you want to release
a new major version etc.

If you have any other questions, let me know.

Thanks!

Veselin
